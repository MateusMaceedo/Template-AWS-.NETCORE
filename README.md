# Template-AWS .NETCORE

Aiming to establish a standardization for apis in .NET CORE, build a clean architecture model structure, in this way we can get a strong mismatch between the components between the application components, generating an easily testable code and we can get quick changes in its development. The Template that is in this repository seeks to meet the main points of a clean architecture, which are:

- Strong Decoupling
- Domain Centrality
- Testable Code
- Speed ​​in Development

***NOTE***: It is not mandatory to adopt all layers, but the main objective is that your domain is always decoupled.
